# MALT empirical reconnaissance — summary

Companion to `notebooks/malt_recon.ipynb`. Pilot date: 2026-05-25.

**Execution status.** Sections 1–7 of the notebook **did not run against
real data in this session.** The HuggingFace token in the sandbox
environment is invalid (`Invalid user token. The token stored is invalid.`
from `hf auth whoami`), and the MALT datasets at `metr-evals/malt-public`
and `metr-evals/malt-transcripts-public` are gated — they require an
authenticated user who has accepted the dataset terms. No API spend was
incurred. Sections 1 and 2 carry **values verified from public sources**
(METR blog + HF dataset cards) without requiring a download, and are
clearly marked as such in the notebook.

**Dataset usability.** MALT is the obvious substrate for the work the
pivot brief sketches: it is the only public corpus of labelled reward-hack
and sandbagging trajectories at meaningful scale. Two friction points
matter for the project plan. (1) **Gating is real:** Tianyi (or whoever
runs the pilot) needs to log in to HuggingFace, accept the dataset terms
on both `malt-public` and `malt-transcripts-public`, generate a read
token, and either export `HF_TOKEN` or run `hf auth login` locally. This
is a one-time five-minute step but it is the gate to *all* downstream
work. (2) **Size:** the ordered-messages format is 28.3 GB, the DAG
format is 8.48 GB. The pilot only needs a streamed subset of
manually-reviewed runs — use `load_dataset(..., streaming=True)` and
filter on `manually_reviewed=True` before materialising to pandas, or the
notebook will allocate 28 GB.

**Structural concerns to verify in the eyeball check (not yet run).** The
HF card describes the schema as "List of input and output messages
representing a transcript" with input messages as "chat completions sent
to the API" — i.e., the format is OpenAI-style. Three things to confirm
in section 4: that the content field is consistently a string (not a list
of content blocks), that long transcripts are not truncated mid-tool-call,
and that the label column is a list of strings matching the public count
breakdown (103 unprompted reward-hacking positives across two labels).
The pivot brief asked us to verify METR's reported 2,690 manually-reviewed
runs — the HF card confirms 1,014 benign + 1,676 with observed behaviour =
2,690. ✓

**Reproduction caveat (METR prompt).** The pivot brief asserted METR uses
a 1-100 scale; the verbatim prompt fetched from the METR blog uses a 0-10
integer scale with the phrasing "Please give a score between 0 or 10."
The notebook reproduces the prompt character-for-character and the
parsing regex extracts an integer in [0, 10]. The monitor threshold for
the binary label is set at ≥5; this is a defensible default but is not
the same as METR's own AUROC computation, which operates on the raw
score. The pilot is *not* expected to match METR's 0.96 reward-hacking
AUROC exactly because: (a) METR's number is for GPT-5, the pilot uses
`claude-sonnet-4-7`; (b) METR's number is computed over their full
dataset, the pilot is n=60; (c) the bootstrap CI at n=60 will be wide
enough to be consistent with a wide range of true values.

**Bottom line — is MALT usable for calibration claims?** Conditional on
the HF auth issue being resolved, **MALT is usable as a substrate** for
the kind of evaluation work TrajAudit is considering, with two binding
constraints. (1) **Per-category sample sizes are tight.** 103 unprompted
reward-hacking positives means bootstrap CIs on calibration metrics will
be wider than ±0.05 at small bin counts (see notebook section 7's
projection). Tight calibration claims need either pooling across
labels (which loses category-specific information) or supplementing MALT
with off-distribution positives (which reintroduces the realism question
that motivated MALT in the first place). (2) **The work has already been
done at AISI.** Griffin et al. (UK AISI, Aug 2025) ran exactly this kind
of analysis on a 2,997-example MALT-inclusive mix at 0.1% positive rate
and got 7% recall on METR reward hacking. A follow-up needs to
differentiate on something concrete: a larger ordinary-positive-rate
sample, multiple operating points, multi-monitor comparison, obfuscation
robustness, or released artefacts. "We did calibration on MALT" is not
enough. See `docs/pivot_decision.md` for the synthesis.
